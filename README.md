# Room_Capacity_Tracker
The Fall 2015 Raspberry Pi project -- led by Daniel Turcich (Buffet-Time)

This project will be mainly written in Python because it's being built off of a Raspberry Pi
Along with the Python script that handles the actual capacity counting we will be creating a Website and maybe a small app to display the capacity.
